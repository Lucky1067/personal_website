    <h2> About me</h2>

<p> My name is Lucky Mahil, I am currently a student enrolled in BCIT’s CIT diploma program. 
    Previously I was working at Home Depot, Dulux Paint’s, Vessel packing co and FRP fireplace products. 
    Working at these places was fun, I learned a lot, but I cannot see myself supporting my <strong> aging</strong> parents on the wage I was making. 
    So, I decided to go back to school. I chose CIT because I have always had an interest in computers and technology, even from a young age.
     I applied in the summer and thankfully got accepted into the program. 
     In order to prepare I went through some A+ material, I also took apart my old PS3 console, applied thermal paste and then installed homebrew. 
     I learned a bit of knowledge from this, but nothing could prepare me for the <em> sheer volume </em>of the information coming my way at BCIT. 
     I have been adjusting my schedule and study habits so that I can hopefully become more efficient. 
     The courses interesting me the most currently are:
<ul>
    <li> ACIT 1620</li>
    <li> COMM 1116</li>
    <li> <a href=http://www.bcit.ca/outlines/acit1420> ACIT 1420</a> </li>
</ul>
