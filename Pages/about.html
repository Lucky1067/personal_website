    <p> My name is Lucky Mahil, I am currently a student enrolled in BCIT’s CIT diploma program. 
        Previously I was working at Home Depot, Dulux Paint’s, Vessel packing co and FRP fireplace products. 
        Working at these places was fun, I learned a lot, but I cannot see myself supporting my <strong> aging</strong> parents on the wage I was making. 
        So, I decided to go back to school. I chose CIT because I have always had an interest in computers and technology, even from a young age.
         I applied in the summer and thankfully got accepted into the program. 
         In order to prepare I went through some A+ material, I also took apart my old PS3 console, applied thermal paste and then installed homebrew. 
         I learned a bit of knowledge from this, but nothing could prepare me for the <em> sheer volume </em>of the information coming my way at BCIT. 
         I have been adjusting my schedule and study habits so that I can hopefully become more efficient. 
         The courses interesting me the most currently are:
